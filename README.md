# Olthaltlzpz.exe-Malware
I somehow made a comeback. C++ HSL GDI Malware. Made for Educational Purposes Only, I'm NOT responsible for any damages. Works in Windows XP-11. Credits to ArTicZera (and wipet of course) for the HSL Shader System.
<br> This uses PRGBTRIPLE too, so I recommend to set your resolution to 1920x1080, 1280x720, 1440x900, 1024x768 or 800x600
